v2.1.7
Sep 25 2019 - E. Merlin
Corrected minor bug in output options.

v2.1.6
Jun 27 2019 - E. Merlin
Added segmentation fluxes and areas.

v2.1.5
Mar 20 2019 - E. Merlin
Added option to force the computation of Kron radius giving a,e,theta as input.

v2.1.4
Feb 5 2019 - E. Merlin
Added __future__ import for print functions.

v2.1.3
Dec 6 2018 - E. Merlin
Fixed a bug in blending/contamination flagging algorithm, and a bug in the computation of the position angle.

v2.1.2
Nov 27 2018 - E. Merlin
Included useless option to directly output catalog in microJy (for lazy astronomers).

v2.1.1
Nov 20 2018 - E. Merlin
Options for WCS input included.
Flagging revised and completed; option for pixel substitution now generates copies of the arrays so that flagging is performed on the original images.

v2.1.0
Nov 8 2018 - E. Merlin
Added flagging of objects Ã  la SExtractor. Also, because of that RMS_tol is now an input parameter.

v2.0.3
Sep 18 2018 - E. Merlin
Added option for substitution of bad/contamiated pixels with values of the ones symmetric wrt the center of the object.

v2.0.2
Aug 2 2018 - E. Merlin
Corrected a bug on the computations of errors for circular apertures in "best S/N" mode.

v2.0.1
May 24 2018 - E. Merlin
Added optional clipping of n*sigma pixels in flux summation.
Magnitude catalogue made optional.

v2.0
Feb 21 2018 - E. Merlin
Added optional use of flag map. Corrected ambiguous variable fac_sigma in moments.c.

v1.2.8
Feb 14 2018 - E. Merlin
Added (optional) magnitude output catalogue.

v1.2.7
Jan 16 2018 - E. Merlin
Added mu_max in output. Revised morpho file naming. 

v1.2.6
Mar 16 2017 - E. Merlin
Revised methods to compute background (loop with morphological parameters
computation, and median/mode method as in SExtractor). Also, minor changes in
morpho parameters methods.

v1.2.5
Jan 27 2017 - E. Merlin
New modules to compute morphological parameters (semi-axis, ellipticity,
position angle, Kron radius) and revised Py script to obtain input catalog
from SExtractor catalogue (with options to read in morpho parameters or
to switch to internal computation)

v1.2.4
Nov 21 2016 - E. Merlin
Revised background module, using RMS map (and after testing)

v1.2.3
Aug 1 2016 - E. Merlin
Added background subtraction module

v1.2.2
Jul 8 2016 - E. Merlin
Corrected bug in determination of best SN aperture (sqrt of uncertainty)

v1.2.1
Jun 29 2016 - E. Merlin
Corrected bug in determination of pixel positions

v 1.2
Jun 17 2016 - E. Merlin
Added option to find best SN elliptical aperture with bisection method

v 1.1
Jun 14 2016 - E. Merlin
Added Python envelop, and file with elliptical multiplicative factors for
Kron radii

v 1.0
Jun 1 2016 - E. Merlin
The basic code
